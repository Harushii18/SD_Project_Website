## Overview

The admin is the only user of the website. The purpose of the website is to create a user-friendly interface which makes it easy for the system administrator to make changes to the data in the database. 

The admin needs to be able to perform CRUD functions on the various tables in the database. The admin needs to be able to create, update and delete Users, Hospitals, Specialties, Programmes, Groups and Blocks, on the database.
